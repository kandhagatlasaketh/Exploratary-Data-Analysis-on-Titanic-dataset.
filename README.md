1)Titanic EDA – Data Analyst Internship Task
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2)Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the data.
- Explore survival patterns by gender, passenger class, age, fare, and embarkation town.
- Generate visual insights to support decision-making and future modelling.

3) Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

4)Key Findings
- Females and 1st class passengers have much higher survival rates.
- Higher fare (ticket price) is associated with better chances of survival.
- Children and young adults tend to survive more than some older age groups.
- Embarkation port also shows differences in survival proportions.

5)How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open the notebook: `titanic_eda.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
