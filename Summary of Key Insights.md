### Summary of Key Insights



1\) The dataset is imbalanced: more passengers did not survive than survived.

2\) Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, reflecting the women and children first evacuation rule.

3\) Passenger Class \& Fare: Passengers in 1st class and those who paid higher fares had better survival chances, indicating socio-economic advantage.

4\) Age: Children and young adults show relatively better survival rates compared to some older age groups.

5\) Embarkation Port: Passengers from Cherbourg appear to have higher survival proportions than those from Southampton and Queenstown.

6\) Strong patterns in sex, class, age, and fare make them important features for any predictive model on survival.
